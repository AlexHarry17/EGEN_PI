# EGEN 310 - RC car controller and raspberry pi code

The code in this repository is linked to the Montana State University course EGEN 310 - multidisciplinary engineering design.

Written in Flutter, four basic parts are combined to create a Smart phone controller for an RC car. They connect through a raspberry pi. 

1) UI - User interface
2) rapberry pi scripts
3) network connection
4) car controls (motor and servos)
